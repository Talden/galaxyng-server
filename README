This is `gngserver', a server for the PBeM game GalaxyNG which is
defined by runtime loadable modules.  It is wrapped around Thomas
Tanner's libltdl implementation from libtool-1.4, so is able to load
modules on just about any platform with a C compiler, and a reasonable C
library.

GNGServer itself consists of the library, libgngserver.la, and the
headers installed in `/usr/local/include/gngserver'.

This distribution also includes a complete server, which reads input
from incoming emails and directly delivered communications and feeds it
to a bunch of modules to provide complete server functionality.  You
could easily make it work entirely differently by changing the way the
input stream is collected, and/or the set of modules it loads.

One of the uses of this feature is to allow variant games to be tried
out.
