This is `gngserver', a game server for the PBeM game GalaxyNG which is
defined by runtime loadable modules. The loadable module support is
based on code published in C/C++ Users Journal, July 2004, Arthur
J. Musgrove. 

From the code:

//

//
// Reproduction rights granted to C/C++ Users Journal and inclusion
// in other works is allowed so long as this copyright notice

So, while I've made modifications to the code to support the slightly
different way I do things, at least the intellectual heritage of the
plugin portion of the source has been acknowledged.
